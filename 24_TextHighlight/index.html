        <h1>100 Words Essay on War</h1>
        The greatest destroyers of people in modern times are wars. No matter who wins a war, mankind loses in every
        case. Millions of people have died in battles during the past century, with World Wars I and II being the worst.
        Wars are typically fought to protect a nation. Whatever the motive, it is hazardous conduct that results in the
        loss of millions of priceless innocent lives and has dangerous impacts that even future generations will have to
        deal with.

        The results of using nuclear bombs are catastrophic. The weapons business benefits when there is a war elsewhere
        in the world because it maintains its supply chain. Weapons that cause massive destruction are being made bigger
        and better. The only way to end wars is to raise awareness among the general public.
